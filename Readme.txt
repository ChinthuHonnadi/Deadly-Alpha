Risk Impact: The attacker can extract sensitive internal network paths from process memory and access unsecured SMB shares to collect confidential information, internal policies, network architecture details, and other operational data. This significantly aids reconnaissance activities, which could be leveraged in broader attacks including privilege escalation, lateral movement, and further data compromise.

Recommendations: It is recommended to:

Restrict the ability of non-administrative users to create memory dumps of application processes within Citrix sessions.

Sanitize application memory where possible by avoiding the storage of sensitive paths, credentials, or configuration details in cleartext.

Secure all SMB shares by enforcing strict access controls, ensuring that only authorized and authenticated users can access sensitive files.

Audit SMB shares regularly for permission misconfigurations and unnecessary exposure.

Implement network segmentation to limit the exposure of critical resources to Citrix session networks.

Monitor for unauthorized access attempts to internal SMB resources and generate alerts for anomalous activities.
