🔐 Broken Access Control (BAC) / Vertical Privilege Escalation
✅ Implement strict, consistent role-based access control checks across all endpoints, especially those that access or modify sensitive data or trigger privileged actions.

🚫 Client-Side Validation Bypass
✅ Enforce all business logic and data validation on the server side, regardless of any client-side restrictions or UI-level validations.

📄 Improper Error Handling / Verbose Stack Traces
✅ Sanitize error responses across the application to ensure internal details such as stack traces, file paths, or server versions are never exposed to the client.

📦 Malicious File Upload
✅ Apply file validation, content inspection, and malware scanning consistently across all file upload features in the application.

🌍 Internal IP / Infrastructure Disclosure
✅ Remove or sanitize all debug messages, server headers, and internal references across the platform to avoid disclosing sensitive infrastructure details.

📁 Metadata Exfiltration via File Uploads
✅ Strip all metadata (EXIF, XMP, IPTC) from uploaded files across the application before rendering, processing, or storing them.

⚠️ CSRF Protections
✅ Enforce CSRF protection tokens across all state-changing endpoints in the platform, regardless of perceived sensitivity.
